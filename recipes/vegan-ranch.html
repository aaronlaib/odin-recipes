    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
      This is a Dairy-Free, Paleo, Whole30 Ranch that's easy to make and perfect
      for veggie dipping, drizzling on a bed of greens, or as a dipper for all
      of your favorite dip-needing foods.</p>
      
      <p>Our quick recipe makes it easy for you
      to say goodbye to highly-processed ranch dressings made with
      unpronounceable ingredients and cheap, inflammatory oils. Once you make
      it, you'll be saying hello creamy, dreamy, homemade ranch made with fresh,
      real-food ingredients.</p>
