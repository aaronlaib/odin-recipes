      <li>3 small/med acorn squash</li>
      <li>1 small onion diced</li>
      <li>2 celery stalks diced</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic minced</li>
      <li>2 cups fresh spinach</li>
      <li>1 small apple diced</li>
      <li>1 Tbsp fresh rosemary leaves</li>
      <li>1 Tbsp fresh thyme leaves</li>
      <li>1 tsp coconut oil</li>
      <li>sea salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 425Â°. Cut squash lengthwise; scoop out seeds/strings.
        Brush squash halves with oil and sprinkle lightly with salt. Place
        squash face down on a lightly greased baking sheet, and roast 25-30
        minutes, flip after 15 minutes. Squash should be slightly soft to the
        touch.
      </li>
      <li>
        While squash roasts, prepare stuffing. Heat a large skillet over
        medium-high heat and add 1 Tbsp oil. Add meat, browning evenly. Remove
        from heat and transfer to a plate.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook onions (about 3 min). Stir in garlic and cook for 1 min. Add
        apples, herbs, spinach, and salt/pepper. Cook for 2-3 min until apples
        are soft and spinach is wilted.
      </li>
      <li>
        Return sausage back to the skillet (and optional cranberries, pecans),
        turn heat to medium/low and continue to cook 2 minutes to blend flavors.
      </li>
      <li>
        Arrange squash halves face-up on baking sheet. Scoop stuffing mixture
        into each. Return pan to oven (optional: broiler) and heat until tops of
        stuffing and squash are browned, (about 5 min). Garnish with fresh
        minced parsley and serve./li>
